## About Me
Hi everyone! My name is **Sara** and this is my sixth course in the _Learning Design and Technology_ program here at **NSCU**. Currently, I live in [Carrboro, NC](https://www.townofcarrboro.org/). In December, I started a new job as a virtual teacher to an awesome group of Kindergartners and First Graders at an online charter school in my home-state of Michigan called [Uplift Michigan Online School](https://uplift-mi.org/). Although I enjoyed teaching in traditional brick and mortar schools for seven years, I **love** teaching online. 

### Hobbies
My husband _lovingly_ says I have a "hobby of making hobbies." This is definitely true in that I like to learn a lot of different things. Here are my current favorites: 
* **Sewing** - After years of failing to figure out how to thread the bobbin on my sewing machine, I made it a goal during the pandemic to figure it out. I made a dress that was _mostly_ wearable. 
* **Furniture Restoration** - I love finding worn out pieces of furtniture at thrift stores or next to dumpsters and giving them new life. 
* **Chess** - Like so many others during the pandemic, I watched _The Queen's Gambit_ on Netflix and decided to learn to play chess. My husband had long been trying to me but I finally put in the effort and occassionally beat him!
